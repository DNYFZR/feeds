<h1 align="center">Building a Fallout Pip Boy App with React</h1>

December 2024

When the Fallout tv show came out, it had been a while since I last played Fallout (4), 
but one of the things that really stuck with me was the cool retro tech vibe they have throughout the games & show/

At the time, I was pretty deep into typescript / react, and I was looking for an interesting challenge, 
so with the pip-boy being pretty iconic throughout the entire Fallout world, it felt like a great choice.

### Design

As I mentioned this one was typescript & react...

### Build

The core features are constructed as components...

The source code is available in the repo : [pipOS](https://github.com/DNYFZR/pipOS)

### Deploy

The deployment is handled by Github Actions, any update to main (via PR) will be built

### Result

You can find the live app here : [pipOS web app](https://dnyfzr.github.io/pipOS/)

### Future... ?

I have a few ideas, there are always things that could be implemented better, and there's also tauri.

I looked at tauri, but I'm not sure it would necessarily add anything here, particularly as this is primarily about the interface,
though it would be nice if I could bundle it up to run on other devices... maybe one day... but probably not...
